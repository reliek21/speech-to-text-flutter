# Voice Test App

A Flutter speech-to-text application focused on maximizing recognition accuracy.

## What it does

This app converts speech to text with optimized settings to achieve 98%+ recognition accuracy. It supports multiple languages (English and Spanish variants) with real-time confidence scoring.

## How it works

- **Advanced Configuration**: Uses optimized speech recognition settings (60s listen time, 5s pause, dictation mode, 44.1kHz sample rate)
- **Multi-language Support**: Includes English (US/UK/AU) and Spanish (ES/MX/AR) with language switching
- **Auto-detection**: Smart language detection feature tests multiple locales to find the best match
- **High-confidence Filtering**: Only accepts results above 70% confidence for final text
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live confidence percentage display with color-coded accuracy indicators

## Why it exists

Standard speech recognition often struggles with accuracy due to poor configuration and language mismatches. This project demonstrates how proper setup, language selection, and confidence filtering can dramatically improve recognition rates from typical 60-80% to 98%+ accuracy.
